# CatSystem2SimpleTools
Single-click tools to "extract movies, images and text right into editable state" and "pack all it back". Or as simple as I am able to make it :D (WIP)

HUGE thanks to Trigger and his **[TriggersTools.CatSystem2 wiki](https://github.com/trigger-segfault/TriggersTools.CatSystem2)**


Unpacker v0.5.2 features:
1) extracts:

    1.1) .int and .zt archives (using exkifint_v3.exe by asmodean)
    
    1.2) .hg2 and .hg3 into minimalistic .bmp (using hgx2bmp_noexpand.exe by asmodean)
    
    1.3) .cst into .txt (tho, it's .cst -> .out -> .txt, but no-one will see .out files :D)
2) results in files in according folders:

    2.1) folder animations with .anm files (no unpacker for those yet)
    
    2.2) folder images with .bmp and .jpg files (already unpacked from .int, .hg2 and .hg3 formats)
    
    2.3) folder movies with .mpg files
    
    2.4) folder scripts with .fes and .kcs files (no unpacker for those yet)
    
    2.5) folder sounds with .ogg and .wav files
    
    2.6) folder texts with .txt files (already unpacked from .cst files)
    
    2.7) if there were no files moved into folder after whole process - folder is removed (since it's empty)

Tested successfully on Grisaia 1, 2, 3; example of extracting some int-archives from The Fruit of Grisaia is attached as screenshot.


Todo list:

0) make main game's .bin and .exe usage easier for user (teach unpacker how to understand which file it needs to use)
1) duplicate clear text lines from .txt(which are with game code right now) into .xlsx to have 1st column as original text and 2nd column for enthusiasts' translation (which then will be read and packed by "all-in-one" packer)
2) move functions from .php files into .exe, .py. or .bat files, since now it requires user to install PHP in order to run this tool (it also requires Python 3.10, but that's easier than PHP, means acceptable, imo ðŸ¤” )
3) implement .fes unpacker (if possible?)
4) implement .kcs unpacker (if possible?)
5) implement .anm unpacker (if possible?)
